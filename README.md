QuoteIt! "This is a quote to quote" /u/username

#Issues
**My quote didn't get a reply, what happened??**
Several things could have happened. For starters, the following are likely:
1) The server the bot is running on is down and/or the bot has crashed due to an unexpected error/bug.
2) The format of the post is incorrect and does not include all the necessary formatting required for the bot to respond. If you believe the format is correct, contact me at /u/camerongagnon with the content of your original post so I can provide feedback, or check on the reason for this discrepancy.
3) The subreddit you are posting from may have banned all bots, or just specifically QuoteItBot.
4) If for some reason QuoteItBot comments too much, it may be rate limited and required a larger time delay between posting comments. This would cause a delay, but not a complete lack of response.

**What happens when a post from QuoteItBot gets upvoted beyond a certain point?**
When a post receives more than a certain threshold of votes, it will be posted on /r/Quotes. This signifies that enough Redditors value this quote, that they essentially 'approved' it to be shared with others. Currently the threshold is set as a static value, but is considered being changed by how popular a post/subreddit is and setting the threshold based on that value. When browsing /r/Quotes, any posts beginning with [QuoteItBot] are posted by the bot, and have received the specific amount of upvotes.
